# Potion's Belt — Session notes

## Session 1 (2026-07-13): planning, loader decision, old-code triage

**Summary: chose Fabric 1.21.11; old Fabric template is reusable, MCreator/NeoForge attempt discarded; PLAN.md written and awaiting confirmation.**

- Inspected the two previous attempts in `D:\scr0ols\Dev\Minecraft Projects`:
  - `potions-belt-fabric-1.21.11`: standard fabric-example-mod template,
    Mojang mappings, pinned versions (Loader 0.18.4, API 0.141.3+1.21.11,
    Loom 1.15, Java 21). Gradle setup and assets reusable. Its one crash
    (2026-03-19) was `NullPointerException: Block id not set` from the
    `potion_shelf` block in `ModBlocks` — block registered without `setId`
    on `BlockBehaviour.Properties`. Blocks are out of scope, so the whole
    class is dropped rather than fixed.
  - `potions-belt-neoforge-mcreator-1.21.8`: MCreator-generated workspace,
    empty item stub. Discarded — MCreator regenerates sources from its own
    workspace file, incompatible with hand-written development.
- Loader decision (Fabric) and full reasoning recorded in PLAN.md; to be
  copied into README.md at repo init so it isn't revisited.
- GitHub repo `scr0ols/Potions-Belt` exists with a single initial commit
  containing only a LICENSE (MIT). Local project is not yet a git repo; plan
  is to `git init` here and merge that remote history at repo init.
- Template leftover to fix when importing code: package is
  `scr0ols.potionsbelt.modid` — the `.modid` suffix is template noise, new
  package is `scr0ols.potionsbelt`.
- Key design choice: belt inventory stored in vanilla
  `DataComponents.CONTAINER` (`ItemContainerContents`, same as shulker
  boxes) — no custom codec, free NBT serialization and sync. Drinking rides
  the vanilla item-use system (`startUsingItem` / `finishUsingItem`), no
  custom timers.
